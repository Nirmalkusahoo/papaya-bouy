        <h6>
          I am a problem solver, an art enthusiast, and a holistic designer who
          is performing at the junction of design and crafting meaningful ideas.
        </h6>
        <p>
          With a product specialist background, I understand how to put the user
          at the center of design. I do this by empathizing with the users and
          discovering their motivations, needs, and pain points. I possess two
          years of experience in a tech company, where I am working part-time as
          a web designer.

          I’m looking for full-time and freelance UI/UX designer positions in
          Berlin. I want to work with a team that is enthusiastic about creating
          user-centric projects. I believe the excitement of working with people
          in a close-knit group makes solving problems more manageable. I have
          the skills and experience of a seasoned designer and can’t wait to use
          them for the next opportunity. I can take a diverse responsibility
          that help me gain new skills and expertise.
